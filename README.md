## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn an easier way to center a div.

```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to improve my use of CSS flexbox and to practice more attributes. Making it easy to came up with solutions for my problems.
